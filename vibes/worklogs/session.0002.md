# Development Session #0002 (2025-07-24): Build technical foundation with MVC architecture

**Session goal:** Begin the technical foundation using prompt-toolkit package with MVC architecture (Model-Controller, not full MVC initially, then realized need for full MVC).

## Task: Create minimal scratch script to test prompt-toolkit with history

Before implementing the main architecture, test that prompt-toolkit can provide the Linux terminal experience we want.

- Created `scratch/test_prompt.py` with minimal command loop
- Implemented FileHistory for persistent command history
- Used Linux-style prompt format: `user@gamehost:~$ `
- Tested up/down arrow history navigation
- Confirmed prompt-toolkit integration works perfectly

## Task: Design Model classes (FileSystem, Shell, Host)

Architecture evolved during discussion - realized commands are the View layer, so need full MVC.

- Created `cli_game/models.py` with three core classes:
  - `FileSystem`: Pure filesystem operations (list_directory, file_exists, is_directory)
  - `Shell`: Environment state (cwd, prompt generation, hostname, username)  
  - `Host`: Complete machine state containing FileSystem + Shell instances
- Implemented as stubs to establish structure without full functionality
- Designed for single host now, but architecture supports multiple hosts later

## Task: Design Controller classes (CommandParser, GameLoop)

Implemented working Controller layer to complete the technical foundation.

- Created `cli_game/controller.py` with:
  - `CommandParser`: Uses argparse with subparsers for command parsing
  - `GameLoop`: Main game loop integrating prompt-toolkit with Model layer
- Implemented working `whoami` command returning "nobody"
- Integrated prompt-toolkit history from scratch testing
- Updated `main.py` to run the game loop

## Validation

```bash
# Test the working game
python main.py

# Commands available:
# - whoami (returns "nobody")
# - exit/quit (clean exit)
# - Up/down arrows for history navigation
```

## Outcome

The technical foundation was fully accomplished. Established complete MVC architecture:

- **Model**: FileSystem, Shell, Host classes with clean separation of concerns
- **View**: Commands (to be implemented - whoami is first example)
- **Controller**: CommandParser + GameLoop with prompt-toolkit integration

The game now has a working command loop that looks and feels like a Linux terminal, with proper architecture to support the educational CLI learning objectives. Ready for implementing actual filesystem operations and additional commands.
