# Development Session #0006 (2025-07-24): Simplify filesystem with real file operations

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Understand current filesystem integration
 ✅ Create minimal test script to validate real filesystem approach
 ✅ Implement FileSystem class with real operations under host root directories
 ✅ Update Host class to pass hostname to FileSystem for root directory
 ✅ Remove filesystem serialization methods and update GameState
 ✅ Test complete system integration

# Development Session #0005 (2025-07-24): Code quality improvements and tooling setup

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Add comprehensive type hints
 ✅ Implement comprehensive linting and formatting
 ✅ Project structure improvements  
 ✅ Enhanced user experience
 ✅ Documentation improvements

# Development Session #0004 (2025-07-24): Implement comprehensive game state persistence

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Test JSON serialization approach with multiple hosts
 ✅ Add serialization methods to model classes
 ✅ Create GameState class for persistence management
 ✅ Integrate auto-save functionality in server
 ✅ Validate complete persistence workflow

## Outcome

The goal of implementing comprehensive game state persistence was fully accomplished:

- **Complete serialization**: All game objects (FileSystem, Shell, Host) have JSON serialization methods
- **Multi-host support**: GameState class manages multiple hosts with current host tracking
- **Auto-save integration**: Server automatically saves after every command execution
- **Persistent storage**: Game state saved to `~/.cli-game/save.json` with human-readable JSON format
- **Session continuity**: Complete game state persists between server restarts
- **Comprehensive testing**: All functionality validated with multiple test scripts

The CLI learning game now maintains complete state persistence, ensuring all progress, command history, and host configurations are preserved between sessions.

# Development Session #0003 (2025-07-24): Implement client-server architecture for non-blocking CLI interaction

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Compare communication approaches and design named pipes architecture
 ✅ Test minimal named pipe communication  
 ✅ Implement server component using named pipes
 ✅ Implement client component for command execution
 ✅ Test client-server communication and session persistence

## Outcome

The client-server architecture was fully accomplished. AI can now interact with the CLI game without hanging:

- **Server**: Long-running process maintaining game state and session persistence
- **Client**: Command-line interface sending individual commands and printing responses
- **Communication**: Named pipes providing clean, non-blocking interaction
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MVC architecture

The solution allows AI to execute CLI commands through `python client.py <command>` without getting hung on interactive processes, while preserving all game state between calls.

# Development Session #0002 (2025-07-24): Build technical foundation with MVC architecture

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Create minimal scratch script to test prompt-toolkit with history
 ✅ Design Model classes (FileSystem, Shell, Host)
 ✅ Design Controller classes (CommandParser, GameLoop)
 ✅ Implement basic game loop with single host

## Outcome

The technical foundation was fully accomplished. Established complete MVC architecture:

- **Model**: FileSystem, Shell, Host classes with clean separation of concerns
- **View**: Commands (to be implemented - whoami is first example)
- **Controller**: CommandParser + GameLoop with prompt-toolkit integration

The game now has a working command loop that looks and feels like a Linux terminal, with proper architecture to support the educational CLI learning objectives. Ready for implementing actual filesystem operations and additional commands.

# Development Session #0001 (2025-07-24): Project setup with vibes framework

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Install and configure vibes framework
 ✅ Brainstorm CLI game concept  
 ✅ Document project foundation

## Outcome

Project initialization was fully accomplished. Established solid foundation for development:

- Complete vibes framework integration for AI-assisted development
- Clear game concept with educational CLI learning objectives  
- Proper Python project structure with modern tooling (uv, mypy, prompt-toolkit)
- Documentation framework for tracking progress and design decisions

The project is ready for implementing the core game engine and command discovery mechanics.

# Development History (Generated from Git Log)

*This worklog was generated by analyzing git commit history on July 23, 2025*

## Project Overview

CLI Game project by Eric Burgess, initialized with basic project infrastructure.

## Major Milestones

- **2025-07-23** - Initial project setup (commit: c066802)
  - Added MIT License
  - Created comprehensive Python .gitignore
  - Established git repository

## Recent Development Themes

- **Project initialization** - Basic repository setup with licensing and Python development environment preparation

## Notes

This project was just created and contains only initial setup files. This summary provides context for future vibes sessions. Individual session logs will be created going forward as development progresses.

The .gitignore suggests this will be a Python project with support for modern Python tooling including uv, ruff, and various development environments.
