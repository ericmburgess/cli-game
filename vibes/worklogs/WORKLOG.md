# Development Session #0002 (2025-07-24): Build technical foundation with MVC architecture

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Create minimal scratch script to test prompt-toolkit with history
 ✅ Design Model classes (FileSystem, Shell, Host)
 ✅ Design Controller classes (CommandParser, GameLoop)
 ✅ Implement basic game loop with single host

## Outcome

The technical foundation was fully accomplished. Established complete MVC architecture:

- **Model**: FileSystem, Shell, Host classes with clean separation of concerns
- **View**: Commands (to be implemented - whoami is first example)
- **Controller**: CommandParser + GameLoop with prompt-toolkit integration

The game now has a working command loop that looks and feels like a Linux terminal, with proper architecture to support the educational CLI learning objectives. Ready for implementing actual filesystem operations and additional commands.

# Development Session #0001 (2025-07-24): Project setup with vibes framework

## Tasks completed

 ✅ Install and configure vibes framework
 ✅ Brainstorm CLI game concept  
 ✅ Document project foundation

## Outcome

Project initialization was fully accomplished. Established solid foundation for development:

- Complete vibes framework integration for AI-assisted development
- Clear game concept with educational CLI learning objectives  
- Proper Python project structure with modern tooling (uv, mypy, prompt-toolkit)
- Documentation framework for tracking progress and design decisions

The project is ready for implementing the core game engine and command discovery mechanics.
