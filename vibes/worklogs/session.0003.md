# Development Session #0003 (2025-07-24): Implement client-server architecture for non-blocking CLI interaction

**Session goal:** Create a client-server setup where the server is long-running and the client accepts command-line arguments, allowing AI interaction without hanging on interactive processes.

## Task: Compare communication approaches and design named pipes architecture

Before implementation, evaluated three approaches for client-server communication.

- **Named Pipes (FIFO) - Selected**: Lightweight, filesystem-based, simple synchronization, maintains session state naturally
- **Socket Communication**: More complex but cross-platform and network-ready 
- **File-based Communication**: Simplest but slower due to filesystem polling

Designed architecture with server maintaining single `Host` instance across client calls, no command history (interactive-only), and graceful shutdown via special command.

## Task: Test minimal named pipe communication

Created proof-of-concept scripts to validate named pipe approach.

- Created `scratch/test_pipe_server.py` with basic command processing loop
- Created `scratch/test_pipe_client.py` for sending commands and receiving responses
- Tested bidirectional communication with commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, and `quit`
- Confirmed non-blocking operation and clean server shutdown

## Task: Implement server component using named pipes

Integrated named pipes with existing MVC architecture.

- Created `server.py` extending existing `GameLoop` functionality
- Used existing `CommandParser` and `Host` classes for consistency  
- Added pipe cleanup on startup to handle existing pipes
- Implemented `__shutdown__` command for graceful termination
- Maintained session state between client calls

## Task: Implement client component for command execution

Created simple client for command-line interaction.

- Created `client.py` accepting command-line arguments
- Handles multi-word commands via argument joining
- Writes to command pipe and reads from response pipe
- Outputs server response directly to stdout

## Task: Test client-server communication and session persistence

Validated complete integration with existing game architecture.

- Tested `python client.py whoami` returning "nobody"
- Tested unknown commands returning appropriate error messages
- Tested `python client.py __shutdown__` for clean server termination
- Confirmed server maintains game state between client calls

## Validation

```bash
# Start server
python server.py

# Test commands via client
python client.py whoami
python client.py "unknown command" 
python client.py __shutdown__
```

## Outcome

The client-server architecture was fully accomplished. AI can now interact with the CLI game without hanging:

- **Server**: Long-running process maintaining game state and session persistence
- **Client**: Command-line interface sending individual commands and printing responses
- **Communication**: Named pipes providing clean, non-blocking interaction
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MVC architecture

The solution allows AI to execute CLI commands through `python client.py <command>` without getting hung on interactive processes, while preserving all game state between calls.
