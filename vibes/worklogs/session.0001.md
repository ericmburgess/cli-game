# Development Session #0001 (2025-07-24): Project setup with vibes framework

**Session goal:** Initialize CLI game project with vibes framework and brainstorm game concept.

## Task: Install and configure vibes framework

- Created complete vibes directory structure with all required components
- Added vibes command definitions for development workflow
- Configured project documentation templates and instructions
- Set up Python project infrastructure (pyproject.toml, dependencies)

## Task: Brainstorm CLI game concept

- Conducted brainstorming session to define game concept
- Developed core idea: discovery-based command line learning game
- Planned progressive command evolution system that teaches real Linux skills
- Identified key mechanics: hidden files, command flag discovery, composition learning

## Task: Document project foundation

- Created initial CODEBASE.md with project structure
- Established TODO.md for tracking future development tasks
- Saved detailed brainstorming summary to document design decisions

## Validation

```bash
# Verify project structure
ls -la vibes/
ls -la cli_game/

# Test Python environment
python main.py
```

## Outcome

Project initialization was fully accomplished. Established solid foundation for development:

- Complete vibes framework integration for AI-assisted development
- Clear game concept with educational CLI learning objectives  
- Proper Python project structure with modern tooling (uv, mypy, prompt-toolkit)
- Documentation framework for tracking progress and design decisions

The project is ready for implementing the core game engine and command discovery mechanics.
