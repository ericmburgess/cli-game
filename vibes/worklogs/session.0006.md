# Development Session #0006 (2025-07-24): Simplify filesystem with real file operations

**Session goal:** Simplify the FileSystem class to use real filesystem operations under `constants.FS_DIR`, eliminating persistence complexity.

## Task: Understand current filesystem integration

Analyzed the existing codebase to understand how FileSystem methods are used:

- Found FileSystem methods (`list_directory`, `file_exists`, `is_directory`) were stub implementations returning empty/false values
- Shell's `change_directory` method takes FileSystem parameter but was not implemented
- No commands actually use FileSystem methods yet
- GameState serializes filesystem state via `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` methods

## Task: Create minimal test script to validate real filesystem approach  

Created `scratch/test_real_filesystem.py` to validate the implementation approach:

- Tested FileSystem class backed by real files under `~/.cli-game/fs/{hostname}/`
- Implemented secure path resolution to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Verified file operations (create, list, exists, is_directory) work correctly
- Confirmed host isolation through separate root directories

## Task: Implement FileSystem class with real operations

Updated `cli_game/models.py` with complete real filesystem implementation:

- Added hostname parameter to FileSystem constructor
- Implemented `_resolve_path()` method with security validation  
- Updated all filesystem methods to operate on real files under host root
- Each host gets isolated directory at `~/.cli-game/fs/{hostname}/`
- Automatic root directory creation on host initialization

## Task: Update Host class initialization

Modified Host class to pass hostname to FileSystem:

- Updated FileSystem instantiation in Host constructor to include hostname
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing Host API
- Each host now gets its own isolated filesystem root

## Task: Remove filesystem serialization methods

Cleaned up persistence by removing filesystem serialization:

- Deleted `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods from FileSystem class  
- Updated Host.to_dict() to exclude filesystem data
- Updated Host.from_dict() to remove filesystem deserialization
- GameState now only persists shell state (cwd, command history, current host)

## Task: Test complete system integration

Created `scratch/test_integration.py` to validate the complete system:

- Verified host isolation (webserver vs database hosts see different files)
- Confirmed GameState serialization works without filesystem data
- Tested save/load cycle maintains shell state while files persist automatically
- Validated server/client communication still works with new filesystem

## Validation

```bash
# Test real filesystem implementation  
python scratch/test_real_filesystem.py

# Test complete system integration
python scratch/test_integration.py

# Test server/client communication
python cli_game/scripts/server.py &
python cli_game/scripts/client.py whoami
python cli_game/scripts/client.py __shutdown__

# Verify code quality
./lint
```

## Outcome

The goal of simplifying the filesystem was fully accomplished:

- **Real file operations**: FileSystem class now operates on actual files under `~/.cli-game/fs/`
- **Host isolation**: Each host gets its own filesystem root directory  
- **Eliminated complexity**: Removed filesystem serialization since real files persist automatically
- **Security**: Path traversal protection prevents escaping host root directories
- **Maintained compatibility**: Existing APIs and game state persistence still work
- **Clean separation**: Filesystem = real files, shell state = JSON persistence

The CLI learning game now has a much simpler filesystem implementation that uses real files for storage while maintaining all security, isolation, and persistence features. This eliminates the need for complex JSON serialization of filesystem state.
