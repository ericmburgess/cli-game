# Development Session #0004 (2025-07-24): Implement comprehensive game state persistence

**Session goal:** Implement complete game state persistence for multiple hosts with JSON serialization and auto-save after every command.

## Task: Test JSON serialization approach with multiple hosts

Before implementing persistence, validated the JSON serialization approach.

- Created `scratch/test_serialization.py` to test basic JSON serialization
- Tested multiple hosts with different states (webserver, database)
- Verified JSON serialization/deserialization works correctly
- Confirmed multi-host data structure design

## Task: Add serialization methods to model classes

Added complete serialization support to all game model classes.

- Added `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods to FileSystem class
- Added serialization methods to Shell class (hostname, username, cwd, command_history)
- Added serialization methods to Host class (filesystem + shell composition)
- All classes now support complete state serialization/deserialization

## Task: Create GameState class for persistence management

Implemented centralized game state management with persistence.

- Created `cli_game/game_state.py` with GameState class
- Manages multiple hosts with current host tracking
- Implements save/load operations to `~/.cli-game/save.json`
- Includes error handling and directory creation
- Supports host switching and listing operations

## Task: Integrate auto-save functionality in server

Modified server to use GameState with automatic persistence.

- Updated `server.py` to use GameState instead of single Host
- Added auto-save after every command execution
- Loads existing game state on server startup
- Commands now add to persistent command history
- Maintains session state across server restarts

## Task: Validate complete persistence workflow

Comprehensive testing of the entire persistence system.

- Created `scratch/test_persistence.py` for end-to-end testing
- Verified multiple host persistence and restoration
- Tested host switching and current host tracking
- Confirmed incremental saves work correctly
- Created `scratch/test_server_persistence.py` for server integration testing

## Validation

```bash
# Test serialization approach
python scratch/test_serialization.py

# Test complete persistence workflow
python scratch/test_persistence.py

# Test server integration
python scratch/test_server_persistence.py

# Verify save file creation
ls -la ~/.cli-game/
cat ~/.cli-game/save.json
```

## Outcome

The goal of implementing comprehensive game state persistence was fully accomplished:

- **Complete serialization**: All game objects (FileSystem, Shell, Host) have JSON serialization methods
- **Multi-host support**: GameState class manages multiple hosts with current host tracking
- **Auto-save integration**: Server automatically saves after every command execution
- **Persistent storage**: Game state saved to `~/.cli-game/save.json` with human-readable JSON format
- **Session continuity**: Complete game state persists between server restarts
- **Comprehensive testing**: All functionality validated with multiple test scripts

The CLI learning game now maintains complete state persistence, ensuring all progress, command history, and host configurations are preserved between sessions.
