# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

- The purpose of this codebase summary is for YOU to orient YOURSELF at the
  start of each coding session.
- It is NOT intended to be comprehensive. It's just a high-level ROADMAP.
- KEEP THIS DOCUMENT VERY LEAN! You're going to be revising it at the end of
  most coding sessions. You do not want it changing every time you change a
  function signature or add a class method!
